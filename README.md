# My-First-Project
# Way out
Developed by Fabien Lacordelle 

# Why I choose this game?
It seemed to be great for DOM and Array manipulation.
Build using : HTML; CSS; And JavaScript, as project #1 of the Ironhack WebDev Bootcamp.

# What was the goal?

The goal was to make a "Maze/Memory"  game that would run and deploy in a browser. All made with HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT.

# What's next
- Randomly generated maps
- Add sounds to messages
- Add a little avatar that moves around

# Let's Play !
